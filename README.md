# Customer-Segmentation-with-K-Means-Clustering
## Objective: 
Developed a machine learning model to segment customers based on demographic and financial attributes, aiming to provide insights for targeted marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, K-Means Clustering, StandardScaler.

**Process:**

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized the customer dataset, removing irrelevant features to enhance model accuracy.
- Modeling: Implemented K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer segments based on attributes such as age, income, education level, and debt ratios.
- Visualization: Generated 2D and 3D plots to visually analyze customer clusters, revealing significant patterns in customer demographics and financial behavior.
- Cluster Insights: Analyzed and interpreted the characteristics of each cluster, providing actionable insights into customer profiles, including high-income, low-debt customers, and those at higher risk of default.
  
**Business Impact:**
Enabled the company to tailor marketing strategies and financial products to specific customer segments, improving customer retention and optimizing resource allocation. The project also contributed to the development of risk assessment models, reducing potential losses from high-risk customers.
